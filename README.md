This is a project stub that shows how to make a WPF app that only runs in the system tray.

Since we are using the NotifyIcon class, I decided to name it NotifyIconOnlyWPF.

Technically this is using Winforms because the NotifyIcon doesn't exist in WPF. At least not at the time I am writing this.

But this way you can add use WPF with this setup if needed.
